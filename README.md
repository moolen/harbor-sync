# Harbor Sync
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/moolen/harbor-sync/workflows/Run%20Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/moolen/harbor-sync/actions)

Harbor Sync allows you to synchronize your Harbor robot accounts with your Kubernetes cluster.

## How it works
This project extends the Kubernetes API by adding a Custom Resource `HarborSyncConfig` and a controller that implements a reconciliation loop. This loop takes care of creating and refreshing robot account tokens aswell as distributing the tokens into your namespaces as secrets.

A `HarborSyncConfig` defines which Harbor projects should be synced with which namespaces.
